- SerializedHashTable should be used when order matters. However, I may have used
  it just because you can iterate over it. So, in this case we may want
  to just add an iterator to HashTable and use that.
- poison_expr() has been introduced but it has not been tested.
  For example, when it was introduced, no changes occured
  in the test suite.
